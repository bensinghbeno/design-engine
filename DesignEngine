Introduction
------------
Design Engine is my most fruitful contribution to the Internet Community of Software and Embedded Linux System Lovers.

In this site you may find some useful pieces of information for you to kick start your understanding of becoming a good Embedded System Architect.

Tools that can ignite you to start in the right postion and move forward in the right direction.

All of it comes from my personal experience in Embedded Linux Software and Hardware development for around 9 years since my high school.

.My Motivation
**********************************************************************
 A spark of light that ignites a fire in you..

 Let it glow, let it show your passion so true..
 
 Start it may with tiny little actions..
 
 Acheive it may, In stellar proportions!!

Getting Started
---------------

Will be added soon.. Promise :)


[[X6]]
Making void main() work with GCC 
--------------------------------

void main() in *.cpp files can only be compiled with gcc compiler in the command line by the flag "-xc"
This tells the compiler not to use the "cplusplus backend". cplusplus backend or c++ compiler requires int main() as standard.

 gcc -xc -std=c89  main.cpp
 
[[X6]]
Legacy C Shared library Build & Run
-----------------------------------

 cd design-engine/projects/linux/gcc_legacy
 
 gcc -shared -o libdisplayconsole.so displayconsole.o
 
 gcc -o gcclegacyapp.out main.c -L. -ldisplayconsole
 
 ./gcclegacyapp.out 
 displayOnConsole = Hello gcc legacy c code
